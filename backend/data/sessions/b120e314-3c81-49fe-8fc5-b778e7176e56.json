You'd want to set up a volume mount so that changes in your local social folder are reflected in the container.\n\nFor a more specific approach, could you clarify what type of development environment you're working with? Are you using Docker, or are you looking to set up a specific framework like Firebase, WordPress, or a Python/PyCharm environment? This will help me give you more targeted instructions for your setup.",
